🌊 Smart Water Quality Checker using AI

📖 Overview
A real-time AI-powered water quality monitoring system that analyzes various water parameters to determine its safety for drinking, agriculture, or industrial use. This project promotes public health and sustainable water management by providing instant quality reports and alerts.

📌 Features
📊 Real-time monitoring of water parameters (pH, turbidity, temperature, dissolved oxygen)

🧠 AI/ML model to predict water safety status

📈 Data visualization dashboard for analysis

⚠️ Automated alerts for contaminated or unsafe water

🌐 Cloud-based/Local deployment for remote or onsite usage

📑 Tech Stack
Python (for AI model and data processing)

TensorFlow / PyTorch (for model building)

NumPy, Pandas (for data handling)

Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly (for visualization)

Flask / Streamlit (for web-based dashboard)

IoT Sensors / CSV dataset (for parameter data)

📝 How it Works
Data Collection: Sensor data or dataset containing water parameters is collected.

Preprocessing: Data cleaned and normalized for AI model input.

Model Prediction: AI model predicts the water quality category (Safe/Unsafe/Moderately Safe).

Visualization & Alerts: Dashboard displays water status and raises alerts if required.
